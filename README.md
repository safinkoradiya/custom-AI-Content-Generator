 I built something simpleâ€”but powerful.
It's a custom AI Content Generator that uses OpenRouter API and Tkinter GUI to automate YouTube Shorts script creation.
 ðŸ“œ It generates:
Viral AI predictions
"Dark side of everyday things" scripts
Emotion-infused voiceover rewrites
Why this?
 Because this is my first real step toward becoming a Prompt Engineer, LLM App Developer, and AI-powered Web Dev.
This project helped me:
 âœ… Understand prompt structuring
 âœ… Work with OpenRouter and DeepSeek models
 âœ… Use Python to wrap AI workflows into a usable app
6 months. No shortcuts. Just focused, hands-on learning.
ðŸ”§ Tools I used:
Python (Tkinter)
OpenRouter API (DeepSeek Model)
Prompt Engineering
Text generation logic
If youâ€™re on a similar path or have feedback/suggestionsâ€”Iâ€™d love to connect!
Letâ€™s build the future, one day at a time. ðŸ”¥
